# GraphEvolve.jl

A Julia package for simulating the evolution of clusters in random networks and lattices.

Check the project out on [GitHub](https://github.com/cameronperot/GraphEvolve.jl)!

This package originated as part of [my thesis on explosive percolation](https://github.com/cameronperot/explosive-percolation).

## About

I am currently writing my bachelor's thesis in the computational physics group at Universit√§t Leipzig under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Wolfhard Janke and Dr. Stefan Schnabel.
Percolation theory is a subject with a range of applications, and is often used to model phase transitions in physical systems, such as ferromagnets which have an ordered ferromagnetic phase at low temperatures and a disordered phase at high temperatures.

To be a bit more specific, the topic I am focusing on is explosive percolation, which entails processes where clusters in the graph evolve in such a way that the onset of percolation is delayed until a critical point at which there is a sudden onset of large scale connectivity.
I have designed and am in the process of analyzing a model for evaluating and adding edges to a graph called stochastic edge acceptance, or SEA for short.

Illustrated in the plot below (system size $n = 10^6$) we can see the order parameter $|C| / n$ plotted against the relative number of edges present in the graph $r = t / n$ where $t$ is the total number of edges present.
* ER = Erdos-Renyi Model
* BF = Bohman-Frieze Model
* PR = Product Rule Model
* SEA = Stochastic Edge Acceptance Model

We can see that the BF, PR, and SEA models all exhibit phase transitions at a later point than the reference ER model, which has been proven to transition at $r = 0.5$.
The PR and SEA models both show a significantly higher rate of change in the order parameter near the critical point.
