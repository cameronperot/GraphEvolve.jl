# GraphEvolve.jl

Documentation can be found at [percolation.fun](https://percolation.fun/).

This package originated as part of [my thesis on explosive percolation](https://github.com/cameronperot/explosive-percolation).
It is designed to simulate the evolution of clusters within graphs by randomly selecting and adding edges according to different rules.
