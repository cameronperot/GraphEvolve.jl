# GraphEvolve.jl

Documentation can be found [here](https://cameronperot.github.io/GraphEvolve.jl/).

This package originated as part of [my thesis on explosive percolation](https://github.com/cameronperot/explosive-percolation).
It is designed to simulate the evolution of clusters in random networks and lattices by randomly selecting, evaluating, and adding edges according to different rules.
